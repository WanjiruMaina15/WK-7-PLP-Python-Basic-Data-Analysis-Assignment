Olympic Medal Analysis 2024
📊 Project Overview
This Python project analyzes Olympic medal data from the 2024 Olympics, exploring relationships between countries' economic indicators, population sizes, and their medal achievements.

📁 Dataset
The analysis uses the olympics2024.csv dataset which contains:

Country information with continent classification

Medal counts (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total)

Population data

GDP per capita information

🛠️ Technologies Used
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib: Basic plotting and visualization

Seaborn: Advanced statistical visualizations

Python: Core programming language

📋 Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading & Inspection
Load the CSV file with error handling for file not found, empty data, and parsing errors

Display the first few rows to inspect data structure

Check data types and identify missing values

2. Data Cleaning
Remove rows with missing values

Rename columns for easier reference (e.g., 'GDP per capita (current US$)' to 'GDPpc')

3. Statistical Analysis
Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns

Group data by country and calculate mean gold medals

Calculate average population size by continent

4. Data Visualization
Created Visualizations:
Pie Chart: Distribution of gold medals among European countries

Bar Chart: Average medals (gold, silver, bronze) by continent

Histogram: Distribution of total medals with Matplotlib

Stacked Histogram: Total medals distribution by continent using Seaborn

Scatter Plot: Relationship between population and gold medals

🔍 Key Insights
European countries dominate in gold medal counts

There appears to be a relationship between population size and medal success

Medal distribution varies significantly across continents

Economic factors (GDP per capita) may correlate with Olympic success

🚀 How to Run
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib
Place the olympics2024.csv file in the same directory as the script

Run the Python script:

bash
python olympics_analysis.py
📈 Results
The analysis produces multiple visualizations that help understand:

Which continents and countries performed best in the 2024 Olympics

The relationship between population size and Olympic success

The distribution of medals across different regions

📝 Notes
The script includes comprehensive error handling for file operations

Visualizations are customized with titles, labels, and appropriate styling

The analysis uses both Matplotlib and Seaborn for different visualization needs

🤝 Contributing
Feel free to extend this analysis by:

Adding more economic indicators

Incorporating historical Olympic data for comparison

Implementing machine learning models to predict medal counts

Creating interactive visualizations with Plotly or other libraries

📊 Sample Output
The script generates:

Console output with statistical summaries

Five different visualizations saved as image files

Cleaned dataset for further analysis

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to Olympic success and can help sports organizations and policymakers understand what drives medal performance at the international level.
